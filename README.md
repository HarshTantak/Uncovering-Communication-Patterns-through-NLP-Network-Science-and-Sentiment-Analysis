**Project Title**: Illuminating Corporate Communication: A Multidimensional Analysis of the Enron Email Dataset

## 📌 Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the **Enron Email Dataset** using techniques from **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**, and **Sentiment Analysis**. The dataset, which includes over 500,000 emails from Enron Corporation employees, offers a rich opportunity to study communication dynamics, organizational structures, and emotional patterns within a real-world corporate environment.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify email trends, volumes, and activity distributions.
- Use **Social Network Analysis** to map relationships between individuals and detect influential nodes in the email network.
- Apply **NLP** techniques such as topic modeling and word cloud generation to uncover key themes.
- Conduct **Sentiment and Emotional Analysis** using tools like **VADER**, **TextBlob**, and **NRCLex**.
- Build visualizations to explore word frequencies, sentiment distributions, and emotion classifications.

## 🔬 Key Analytical Components

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Temporal analysis of email volumes (by year, day, and hour)
- Active users and email volume distribution
- Word count analysis for subject and body content

### 🌐 Social Network Analysis
- Directed graph construction of sender-recipient pairs
- In-degree and out-degree distribution
- Visualization of communication patterns

### 💬 NLP & Text Mining
- Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- Word frequency analysis and word cloud visualization
- Common word identification in positive/negative emails

### 😊 Sentiment & Emotion Analysis
- **VADER**: Real-time sentiment scoring (positive, negative, neutral)
- **TextBlob**: Polarity and subjectivity scoring
- **NRCLex**: Emotion tagging (e.g., joy, anger, trust)

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Most emails were exchanged during working hours and weekdays.
- Internal communication reveals emotionally neutral to slightly positive tone overall.
- Some individuals had significantly high communication frequency, pointing to managerial or coordinating roles.
